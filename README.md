## ü§î Assumptions Made

-   **Recent Sales:** "Recent sales activity" is defined as at least one sale occurring in the last 30 days.
-   **Supplier Info:** For products with multiple suppliers, the alert displays the first supplier associated with the product.
-   _(Add any other assumptions you made here)_
