I really enjoyed this challenge. It was a great exercise in thinking about data integrity, API design, and database performance. I aimed to write code that is not only functional but also clean, safe, and maintainable.

Thank you again for the opportunity, and I look forward to hopefully discussing my solutions with you in the live session.

Best,
Roshan Kishor Patil
